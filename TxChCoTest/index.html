		<h3>What is the York Rite?</h3>
		<p>The York Rite is a large collection of degrees, seperated into several bodies, and grouped into one flexible "Rite." Upon completing his Master Mason's proficiency, a Mason has the opportunity to join these bodies. A York Rite Mason might be involved in only one body, or he may be involved in many. The three largest bodies in the York Rite are the Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, the Council of Royal & Select Masters, and the Commandery of Knights Templar, which are more informally known as Chapter, Council, and Commandery. Each one of these organizations is organized independently, as seperate components of the York Rite.</p>
		<p>Texas Chapter #362 and Texas Council #321 meet back-to-back in the Fort Worth Masonic Temple, and share many of the same officers, as is commonly the case for individual Chapters & Councils, due to how well their degrees and oranizations go hand-in-hand. Many members of Texas Chapter and Texas Council are also members of various Commanderies, which meet seperately. The Commandery that meets in the Fort Worth Masonic Temple is <a href="www.worthcommandery.org/">Worth Commandery #19.</a></p>
		<h3>Why should I join the York Rite?</h3>
		<p>The Entered Apprentice degree gave you an instruction manual on how to be a Mason, both in modern times, and in the ancient days of King Solomon's Temple. The Fellowcraft degree painted a beautiful picture of the Temple, and pointed your eyes & mind to higher learning. The Master Mason's degree threw you into the middle of a gripping tale, and taught you the value of fidelity.</p>
		<p>However, at the conclusion of the Master's degree, the story is unfinished. The Temple is incomplete, and knowledge of infinite value, the True Word, has been lost, possibly forever.</p>
