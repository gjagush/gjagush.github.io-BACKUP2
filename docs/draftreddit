To be honest, I'm not really sure as to what my goal is, other than to consume academia vigorously. What you’re describing about Pasqually sounds really interesting as I’m really only just getting started in beginning to tie the Craft, esotericism, and occultism together; and Saint-Martin interests me due to his version of Martinism having a strong focus on meditation; and, of course, Willermoz because of the RER. I guess I’m going to have to dive deep into all three due to the huge differences between them. Pasqually’s take on Martinism seems... intense.

Do you have any tips on determining if something RER/CBCS-related has been distorted by Papus-tradition Martinists?

I had no idea that the Rose+Croix degree was so far off the mark! I’m going into SR in the fall, so I haven’t seen it yet, but a brother in SR described it to me as “only tangentially Rosicrucian,” which in retrospect is probably because it wasn’t Rosicrucian at all! (Based off of this new info.) Once I go through the SR reunion (three weekends, all 29 standard SR degrees, hold my ~~beer~~ Adderall), I’m gonna have to go pull up the old versions of the 18th degree.
