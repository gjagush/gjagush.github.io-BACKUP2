Howdy, R∴W∴ Brother O'Neill!

I am writing on behalf of Stacie Hill, from Lake Worth, Texas. She inquired with me as to whether or not it would be possible to learn more about her grandfather, who was a Mason in Texas. She said that she found a "ceremonial sword" of some kind, so my guess is that Brother Alford may have been involved in Commandery as well. I would love to be able to tell her more about her grandfather if at all possible.

His name was Alford Oscar Little, and he was born on April 7, 1896. Additionally, Stacie asked if it was possible to learn if Brother Alford's father, Nicholas Ocelan Little (date of birth not specified), was a Mason (and if there were records that she could learn more from).

Many thanks in advance for your time!

I am writing on behalf of Stacie Hill, from Lake Worth, Texas. She inquired with me as to whether or not it would be possible to learn more about her grandfather, who was a Mason in Texas. She said that she found a "ceremonial sword" of some kind, which sounds like a Templar sword, so my guess is that Brother Alford may have also been a Companion. I would love to be able to tell her more about her grandfather if at all possible.

Additionally, Stacie mentioned that Brother Alford's father, Nicholas Ocelan Little (date of birth not specified), may also have been a Mason - if there are any records of him being involved in Chapter & Council, I'd love to tell her about him, too.

Many thanks in advance for your time!
