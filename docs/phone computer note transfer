(BIG disclaimer here: we may need to double-check on the Masonic laws involved, but most of this is straight from the GLTX lawbook, so we should be okay.)

That sounds about right! A demit letter should work.

Now, when it comes to demitting, your best course of action is probably to wait until August or September before making the request. Since you moved here in mid-April, you won't be considered "domiciled" in the Grand Jurisdiction of Texas until mid-October. Until you're domiciled, you can't legally petition.

Not being domiciled is not a big deal, if you're a current member of another Grand Jurisdiction. You'll just be another visitor, and can visit any EA/FC meetings that you want to. We'll need to see a photo ID, and some sort of proof that you're a Fellowcraft in your lodge - a letter of good standing or a temporary lodge ID will work just fine. Pretty standard stuff.

Once you request & receive your demit letter, you will be considered an "unaffiliated" Mason. There's a bunch of rules that apply to unaffiliated Masons, but the biggest one is that you can only visit our lodge three times before petitioning. Now, you will have to become an unaffiliated Mason before we can legally accept your petition for advancement (we can't advance Masons outside of our Grand Jurisdiction), but the trick is to spend only a short time being unaffiliated.

If you demit in September or so, you can visit us all summer as an extrajurisdictional visitor, then legally petition for advancement after mid-October, and we'll be able to do the vote/investigation/ballot/etc shortly after that. 

So, basically, it'll be a few months before you can become a member with us, but to kill time until then, you are allowed and welcomed to visit with us, both in and out of lodge.
