		<li>What does the Monitor say?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Monitor is actually censored in regards to this, tread carefully.</li>
			<li><img src="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/lightfoots_manual_of_the_lodge_files/image017.gif"></li>
			<li>There is a specific demand made of the candidate that illustrates CHARITY.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Relevant Lightfoot quote</li>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="/ref/lightfootnortheastcorner.html">North-East Corner</a></li>
			<li>The Brahmans believed that anyone who is terminally ill should travel in northeasterly direction, consuming only water, until their body withered away and their soul was "united with the Supreme." A similar idea is presented here - even if mortal life has ended, the brother has begun to build his spiritual temple.</li>
			<li>The cornerstone is the most important stone of the building.</li>
			<li>The cornerstone is perfectly square and strong.</li>
			<li>Cubes are an emblem of truth.</li>
			<li>The NE corner is between the North (darkness) and the East (Light)</li>
			<li>The cornerstone is constantly checked with the plumb, square, and level.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>How to walk and act as such</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Read your VSL.</li>
			<li>Read other people's VsSL.</li>
			<li>Meditate - think of nothing</li>
			<li>Contemplate - think of the degree symbols and lessons</li>
			<li>Meet and converse with well-informed brethren.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>What does it mean to walk and act as a Mason as opposed to the average profane person?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>As masons, we are held to a higher standard.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Why does this matter, anyway?</li>
		</ul>
