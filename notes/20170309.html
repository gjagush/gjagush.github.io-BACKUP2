		<li>THE QUEST FOR JUDAS MACCABEUS:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Non-Christian alternative to Commandery</li>
				<li>Founded in New York State in the 1970s by Brother Herman Sarachan</li>
				<li>Required one to be a Royal Arch Mason</li>
				<li>Beginning had brothers from the New York Grand Chapter, Council, and Commandery involved</li>
				<li>Intially it seems that it never really made it out of the state of New York, but there were some references that said it had expanded into New Jersey and Connecticut, and that several states, like California and Ohio, had expressed interest (although there is no evidence to suggest they chartered Assemblages of their own).</li>
				<li>I have made contact with one brother that had been in the order, and one who knew a member of the order</li>
				<li>Most of the guys invoved in OOJM seemed to have passed away and/or lack an online presence</li>
				<li>Eventually after reaching out to some very helpful brothers, I acquired a copy of the ritual... for TEXAS. It was a 2007 revision of the work by the late Brother Cliff Cameron, former Grand Historian of the Texas Grand Council.</li>
				<li>There are two degrees - the Order of David and the Order of Judas Maccabeus. There was going to be a third Order, but brother Sarachan died before he could finish it.</li>
				<li>Currently Brother Arturo De Hoyos is working with the Grand College of Rites to find out if there are any Assemblages of the Order left, and if it's truely dead, they'll going to preserve it in the Collectanea.</li>
				<li>You can read more by checking out my material on it by going to texanmason.com. Go to "Archive" at the bottom of the page, and then look for the post titled "The Quest for Judas Maccabeus." I'll link the post in the show notes.</li>
				<li>Anyway, there is a contingent of brothers in New York that is trying to revive the Order. I am in contact with one of them and they are all very busy preparing. Those of them that are not yet Royal Arch Masons are in the process of becoming so, in order to recieve the Orders.</li>
				<li>If you know of any Assemblages of the Order, please reach out to us.</li>

		<li>What does the Monitor say?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Monitor is actually censored in regards to this, tread carefully.</li>
			<li><img src="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/lightfoots_manual_of_the_lodge_files/image017.gif"></li>
			<li>There is a specific demand made of the candidate that illustrates CHARITY.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Relevant Lightfoot quote</li>
			<ul>
			<li><a href="/ref/lightfootnortheastcorner.html">North-East Corner</a></li>
			<li>The Brahmans believed that anyone who is terminally ill should travel in northeasterly direction, consuming only water, until their body withered away and their soul was "united with the Supreme." A similar idea is presented here - even if mortal life has ended, the brother has begun to build his spiritual temple.</li>
			<li>The cornerstone is the most important stone of the building.</li>
			<li>The cornerstone is perfectly square and strong.</li>
			<li>Cubes are an emblem of truth.</li>
			<li>The NE corner is between the North (darkness) and the East (Light)</li>
			<li>The cornerstone is constantly checked with the plumb, square, and level.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>How to walk and act as such</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Read your VSL.</li>
			<li>Read other people's VsSL.</li>
			<li>Meditate - think of nothing</li>
			<li>Contemplate - think of the degree symbols and lessons</li>
			<li>Meet and converse with well-informed brethren.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>What does it mean to walk and act as a Mason as opposed to the average profane person?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>As masons, we are held to a higher standard.</li>
			</ul>
