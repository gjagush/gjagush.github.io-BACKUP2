			<li>Warren Lodge #310 under the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, F&AM recently conferred a special Master Mason's degree. The candidate of the degree is Pennsylvania's only member who uses sign language as his primary means of communication, so when it was time to conferr his Master's Degree, they were interpreted and conferred in American Sign Language.</li>
			<s><li>The Grand Lodge of Mississippi, F&AM, has removed their recognition of the Grand Lodge of Bulgaria. Haven't been able to find a lot of info other than the GL of Mississippi claimed this was because of unmasonic activities. Haven't been able to confirm anything on this.</li></s>
