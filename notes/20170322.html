			<li>The Young County Masonic Lodge #485 Tenth Annual Scholarship Auction was a resounding success. They held it on the 11th, as we'd previously mentioned in the events sections, and they broke every record this year after all the numbers were crunched. They sold 1378 lots totalling $158K worth of merchandise, had 455 registered buyers, and had over 2000 people in attendance. In May, they will be presenting several scholarships to students in each of the three high schools in Young County. Brother Weldon Floyd writes, "Masonry was on display for all to see" and extended his thanks to the members and their families.</li>
			<li>The Texas Lodge of Research had their Stated Meeting on Saturday at the Dallas Scottish Rite Temple. I wasn't able to attend, but they did accept my (Gabe's) petition and elected me as an associate along with five or six other brothers, so I'd like to thank them personally!</li>

			<li>Quincy, Massachusetts. After last Friday, a man and a juvenile are facing multiple firearms charges, and charges of disorderly conduct / resisting arrest after vandalizing an abandoned Masonic Temple by firing a shot through a door of the building. Nobody was hurt.</li>
			<li>Monday marks the 164th anniversary of Albert Pike becoming a Scottish Rite Mason on March 20, 1853, by receiving the 29 degrees from Albert Mackey. Mackey recited the degrees to Pike, and Pike transcribed them. Thanks to Brother Jason Mitchell for that fact!</li>

	<li>Questions</li>
		<ul>
		<li>From Brother Billy Hamilton: do you think that the 1980 scandal of the Vatican Bank associate Michele Sindona and the clandestine P2 lodge (Propaganda Due Lodge, which was exppelled by the Grand Orient of Italy in 1976) might be used as an excuse by the Italian government for their actions? Sindona was found to have links with the Sicilian Mafia. Perhaps this shows how the dangers of clandestine Lodges and their activities can jeapordize the reputations of regular masons?</li>
		<li>How does your lodge represent the network on the pillars / how do they represent the pillars in general? Pomgrant vs pomegranate. Some states, like Pennsylvania, don't have a representation of the pillars at all.</li>
		<li>How should you dress for your interview, as a candidate? How should you dress for lodge?</li>
		<li>Please send us more questions at info148@fortworth148.org or on our Facebook page!</li>
