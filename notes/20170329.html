			<li>On Saturday, the grand Lodge of Ohio authorized a One Day Class. The last time they did one was several years ago. The brothers raised in the class are subject to a bunch of interesting conditions. They have 90 days to attend a stated or called lodge meeting after being raised. If they don't, they get suspended. If they get suspended for this, they can be unsuspended by returning a memorized proficiency (what about the MM obligation?). During the 90 period, they cannot be solicited by any appendant body. If they've met the visitation requirement, they must attend a table lodge in January in order to be declared proficient. Any mason that does the memorized profiency as a bonus to his lodge visit will receive a challenge coin from the Grand Master. During the 1-day class, around 2700 masons were raised across the state of Ohio. One of the brothers who attended said that the ritual work was some of the finest he'd ever seen, and that each candidate had their own individual lights and SD for the obligation and grips/words.</li>
