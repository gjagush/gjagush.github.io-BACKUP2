			<li>Shriners Hospitals - The scientists at the Shriners Hospitals have developed an arthritis vaccine! This really benefits kids with juvenile arthritis and is designed to fight arthritis using stem cells modified for autonomous regenerative therapy. Human clinical trials are still a few years away, with the end goal of being able to grow living bone, cartilage, and so forth. Check out shrinershospitalsforchildren.org for more info.</li>
			<li>Solomon, Kansas - A man has been arrested for the embezzlement of over $150,000 from the Salina County Masonic Temple Foundation. He was hired as the Foundations's treasurer last July, and began embezzling funds only a few months later. Suspiscions arose in early April and were quickly investigated. The police have stated that the individual in question was using foundation funds for airplane trips, hotel stays, and subscriptions to pornographic websites. Additionally, he had allegedly been writing checks to himself and a regalia business he owned. Guard your West Gates, folks.</li>
