            <li>April 29th - Masonic Con 2017 was a resounding success! In Massachusetts, the members of Ezekiel Bates Lodge AF&AM and NAVA Grotto hosted a giant convention at their lodge. Over 400 brothers came to listen to lectures, participate in an esoteric symbolism panel discussion, buy awesome masonic stuff, and receive Tall Cedars and Grotto degrees. A ton of different organizations were there and it seems a great time was had by all. Love the idea, I hope we can implement something like that, too.</li>
