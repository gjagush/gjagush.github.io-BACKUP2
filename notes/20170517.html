            <li>Grand lodge of Maryland - they posted a pretty funny video! Go check it out at the Facebook group, Freemasons of Maryland.</li>
			<li>May 25th - Los Angeles - the former Temple of the LA Scottish Rite Valley has been turned into a private museum, and will be opening. The new owners, the Marciano Art Foundation, will be displaying the prrivate collections of the Marciano brothers.</li>
            <li>Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite - the SRNMJ Supreme Council is releasing a comprehensive guidebook for their degrees! This is something that SR Masons in the NMJ have really been wanting for a long time. The NMJ ritual work is extremely different from SR ritual elsewhere in the world, and there's not a huge amount of resources on it. This is a big step as the last pretty good guidebook for the NMJ was published a hundred years ago. The book is available for $27 and shipping from Cornerstone Publishing.</li>

		<li><em>The Taxil Hoax</em></li></li>
		<li>Touched on this before when discussing Baphomet, but it's a classic, so we talk about it.</li>
		<li>Léo Taxil - Life up to the Taxil Hoax</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Born on March 21st, 1854 in Marseille ("Marr-say"), France, under the name of Marie Joseph Gabriel Antoine Jogand-Pagès.</li>
			<li>Was  placed into Jesuit Catholic school when he was a little kid and quickly developed a pretty strong hatred of Catholicism.</li>
			<li>Started his writing career with a bunch of anti-Catholic books, some of which were pornographic parodies. He also published a daily paper. Some of his works include:</li>
				<ul>
				<li>La Bible amusante pour les grands et les enfants (The Amusing Bible for Grown-Ups and Children</li>
				<li>La Vie de Jesus (The Life of Jesus)</li>
				<li>Les Debauches d'un confesseur (le deboojsh dan confesser) (Confessions of a Confessor</li>
				<li>Les Pornographes sacrés: la confession et les confesseurs (Le Pornugraph Sackreh: la confesyon e le confesser) (Sacred Pornographers: Confession and Confessors)</li>
				<li>Les Maîtresses du Pape (Le Maytrez doo Pap) (The Mistresses of the Pope)</li>
				</ul>
			<li>He ended up actually getting put on trial in the late 1870s for a pamphlet that he wrote, A Bas la Calotte (Aba la Calot) (Down with the Cloth). The justification for this was that he was insulting a state-recognized religion. They ended up letting him off.</li>
			<li>He DID end up getting fined pretty heavily for his book, "The Secret Loves of Pope Pius IX (Ninth)," which came up in a libel case against him.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><em>Humanum Genus</em></li>
			<ul>
			<li>Now, for context, Taxil had been initiated as an Entered Apprentice in 1881 and subsequently expelled for unMasonic offenses...</li>
			<li>Published by Pope Leo the Thirteenth in 1884.</li>
			<li>Mostly a condemnation of Masonry.</li>
			<li>There had been 7 or so papal bulls condemning Masonry prior to this.</li>
			<li>Choice quotes:</li>
				<ul>
				<li>"[The human race is] separated into two diverse and opposite parts, of which the one steadfastly contends for truth and virtue, the other of those things which are contrary to virtue and to truth. The one is the kingdom of God on earth, namely, the true Church of Jesus Christ... The other is the kingdom of Satan... At this period, however, the partisans of evil seems to be combining together, and to be struggling with united vehemence, led on or assisted by that strongly organized and widespread association called the Freemasons."</li>
				<li>"At every period of time each has been in conflict with the other, with a variety and multiplicity of weapons and of warfare, although not always with equal ardour and assault. At this period, however, the partisans of evil seems to be combining together, and to be struggling with united vehemence, led on or assisted by that strongly organized and widespread association called the Freemasons. No longer making any secret of their purposes, they are now boldly rising up against God Himself. They are planning the destruction of holy Church publicly and openly, and this with the set purpose of utterly despoiling the nations of Christendom, if it were possible, of the blessings obtained for us through Jesus Christ our Saviour. Lamenting these evils, We are constrained by the charity which urges Our heart to cry out often to God: "For lo, Thy enemies have made a noise; and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head. They have taken a malicious counsel against Thy people, and they have consulted against Thy saints. They have said, 'come, and let us destroy them, so that they be not a nation.'"</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Taxil heard the KA-CHING of cash registers when he found out about this.</li>
			<li>So what does he do? He very publicly converts to Catholicism, renounced all of his previous literary work, and is welcomed with open arms by the Church. They even pardoned him of several excommunications.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>THE HOAX</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Within a few years, he started publishing a bunch of anti-Masonic stuff.</li>
			<li>Books, pamphlets, and even a dedicated anti-Masonic newspaper.</li>
            <li>Worked with Doctor Karl Hacks, who may or may not have actually existed.</li>
            <li>Came up with crazy stuff about degrees, like simulated murder achieved by killing a shaved sheep.</li>
            <li>Things quickly got crazy</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Floating tables</li>
                    <li>Furniture into crocodiles</li>
                    <li>HE WAS AWARDED WITH THE ORDER OF THE HOLY SEPULCHURE BY POPE LEO THE THIRTEENTH</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Albert Pike, the biggest target</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scottish Rite - fake rituals</li>
                    <li>Pike - fake quotes</li>
                    <li>literal summoning of Satan during the high-grade degrees</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Started getting information from a certain Diana Vaughan</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>supposedly the direct descendant of Thomas Vaughan, a Rosicrucian alchemist who extended his life by 33 years through "demoniacal designs"</li>
                    <li>she betrothed herself as the bride of Asmodeus (a demon)</li>
                    <li>was summoned to stand before Satan himself in Charleston, South Carolina</li>
                    <li>was consecrated a High Priestess of Satan, by Satan, in the presence of Albert Pike himself.</li>
                    <li>she could turn into liquid and walk through walls</li>
                    <li>Taxil "converted" her to Catholicism</li>
                    <li>she repented, and wrote an expository book, which Pope Leo the Thirteenth read, causing him to write a letter thanking her for her work against Masonry.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>the prestige</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>More and more questions about Diana pop up</li>
                    <li>Taxil promises to introduce her at a press conference</li>
                    <li>he calls the press conference...</li>
                    <li>Diana Vaughan, the Masonic High Priestess of Satan, never existed.</li>
                    <li>Diana Vaughan, the professional typist in the employ of Leo Taxil, did.</li>
                    <li>Series of hoaxes - Marseille harbor shark infestation, underwater city in Lake Geneva, and finally, the Masonic hoax, Diana included.</li>
                    <li>He thanked the bishops and Catholic newspapers for helping his hoax be born and for making him wealthy through their anti-Masonic sentiments.</li>
                    <li>The audience was furious.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Taxil thought this was hilarious</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The public made me what I am, the arch-liar of the period, for when I first commenced to write against the Masons my object was amusement pure and simple. The crimes laid at their door were so grotesque, so impossible, so widely exaggerated, I thought everybody would see the joke and give me credit for originating a new line of humour. But my readers wouldn't have it so; they accepted my fables as gospel truth, and the more I lied for the purpose of showing that I lied, the more convinced became they that I was a paragon of veracity."</li>

            <li>Taxil moved out of Paris to quieter pastures and died in the city of Sceaux ("So") in 1907.</li>

        <li>Abel Clarin de la Rive (Ah-bel Clah-reen du la Reeve)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>anti-Mason author</li>
                <li>French, but big in the US</li>
                <li>Relied heavily on Taxil's work</li>
                <li>published the most popular anti-Mason quote out there in his book <em>Woman and Child in Universal Freemasonry</em>, which he attributed to Albert Pike, and cited Diana Vaughan:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><q cite=""><p>That which we must say to the world is that we worship a god, but it is the god that one adores without superstition. To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the brethren of the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees: The masonic Religion should be, by all of us initiates of the higher degrees, maintained in the Purity of the Luciferian doctrine. If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay and his priests calumniate him?</p>
                        <p>Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also god. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods; darkness being necessary for light to serve as its foil as the pedestal is necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive...</p>
                        <p>Thus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy, and the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil.</p></q></li>
