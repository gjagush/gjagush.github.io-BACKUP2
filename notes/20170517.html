			<li>May 25th - Los Angeles - the former Temple of the LA Scottish Rite Valley has been turned into a private museum, and will be opening. The new owners, the Marciano Art Foundation, will be displaying the prrivate collections of the Marciano brothers.</li>
            <li>Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite - the SRNMJ Supreme Council is releasing a comprehensive guidebook for their degrees! This is something that SR Masons in the NMJ have really been wanting for a long time. The NMJ ritual work is extremely different from SR ritual elsewhere in the world, and there's not a huge amount of resources on it. This is a big step as the last pretty good guidebook for the NMJ was published a hundred years ago. The book is available for $27 and shipping from Cornerstone Publishing.</li>
