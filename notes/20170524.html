			<li>Fort Worth Lodge - we had a great double-EA degree! I think those two brothers had a blast. We're really glad to have them with us - they've been in the pipe for a while now. Afterwards, we went out to eat and digested both food and ritual. Welcome to the Craft, brothers.</li>
			<li>Texas Chapter - we had a great set of degrees! On Monday, we welcomed three worthy brothers into the York Rite, and taught them how to earn their wages. On Tuesday, we conferred the Past Master & Most Excellent Master degrees on them! Two great nights. We wanted to thank all the Companions that attended those three degree conferrals. We're really looking forwards to the Royal Arch Degree coming up soon.</li>

			<li>New Canaan, CT - Harmony Lodge #67 has fallen prey to a brother betraying his trust. The lodge treasurer has been charged with first-degree larceny after using the lodge's debit card in order to embezzle more than 54 thousand dollars. This happened over the course of four years, and was discovered last month. Last week, on Wednesday the 17th, he turned himself in to New Canaan police. Be careful, brothers. Our thoughts are with the brothers of Harmony Lodge in this trying time.</li>
			<li>Little Falls, NY - Last week, a very interesting house went up for rsale. It's got 3 bedrooms, 1 full bath, 3 half-baths, an area of 12 thousand square feet, and is going for 325 thousand dollars. It also used to be a Masonic Lodge! It's been converted into house. While it's kind of a bummer to see a Lodge building with no Lodges in it, it's uplifting to see that it still has a purpose. </li>
			<li>Detroit, MI - Go check out www.detroit.curbed.com! One of their articles from May 17th has a bunch of gorgeous behind-the-scenes pictures of the Detroit Masonic Temple. </li>

		<li>Disregarding Grand Lodge Law, what's your take on businesses using Masonic emblems? There's a bar in Cork, Ireland that is called "Mason" and their "A" is the S&C. Thoughts on this?</li>
