			<li>Fort Worth Lodge - we had a great double-EA degree! I think those two brothers had a blast. We're really glad to have them with us - they've been in the pipe for a while now. Afterwards, we went out to eat and digested both food and ritual. Welcome to the Craft, brothers.</li>
			<li>Texas Chapter - we had a great set of degrees! On Monday, we welcomed three worthy brothers into the York Rite, and taught them how to earn their wages. On Tuesday, we conferred the Past Master & Most Excellent Master degrees on them! Two great nights. We wanted to thank all the Companions that attended those three degree conferrals. We're really looking forwards to the Royal Arch Degree coming up soon.</li>

				<li>Garland, Texas, in the Hella Shrine Black Horse Patrol Barn</li>
				<li>Wonderful, incredible degree.</li>
				<li>Sung prayers in (I believe) Ponca & Osage</li>
				<li>Goofy parts, and serious parts</li>
				<li>Goosebumps</li>
				<li>Many thanks to Hella Shrine, the MWSA of District #9, and East Fork Lodge #650 for helping make this happen, and most especially, thanks to the Oklahoma Indian Degree Team!</li>
				<li>Many congratulations to our newest Oklahoman Brother Master Mason.</li>

			<li>New Canaan, CT - Harmony Lodge #67 has fallen prey to a brother betraying his trust. The lodge treasurer has been charged with first-degree larceny after using the lodge's debit card in order to embezzle more than 54 thousand dollars. This happened over the course of four years, and was discovered last month. Last week, on Wednesday the 17th, he turned himself in to New Canaan police. Be careful, brothers. Our thoughts are with the brothers of Harmony Lodge in this trying time.</li>
			<li>Little Falls, NY - Last week, a very interesting house went up for rsale. It's got 3 bedrooms, 1 full bath, 3 half-baths, an area of 12 thousand square feet, and is going for 325 thousand dollars. It also used to be a Masonic Lodge! It's been converted into house. While it's kind of a bummer to see a Lodge building with no Lodges in it, it's uplifting to see that it still has a purpose. </li>
			<li>Detroit, MI - Go check out www.detroit.curbed.com! One of their articles from May 17th has a bunch of gorgeous behind-the-scenes pictures of the Detroit Masonic Temple. </li>

	<li>Questions</li>
		<ul>
		<li>What's your ideal way to dispense money out for reimbursements, lodge expenses, etc?</li>
		<li>Disregarding Grand Lodge Law, what's your take on businesses using Masonic emblems? There's a bar in Cork, Ireland that is called "Mason" and their "A" is the S&C. Thoughts on this?</li>

	<li>Episode Content</li>
		<ul>
		<li>The Four Cardinal Virtues</li>
		<li>Disclaimer regarding tyled vs non-tyled material - the Virtues are okay to discuss, but we should avoid discussing how it <em>specifically</em> relates to ritual. Acceptable example: "As y'all know, Prudence relates to modes of recognition, especially as how they appear in ritual."</li>
		<li>Only a brief overview, we might come back to this in a lot more detail later.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Part of the long-form Entered Apprentice lecture</li>
			<li>Entirely omitted from short-form lecture w/ exception to how each Virtue relates to ritual</li>
			<li>Super valuable knowledge</li>
			<li>The short-form lecture portion about this doesn't make much sense at all without the discussion of each virtue. Why does X relate to Y?</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Temperance</li>

			<li>A truly good man is incomplete without a sense of Justice.</li>
			<li>Associated with the East (Worshipful Master, Wisdom)</li>
			<li>Not really related to secrets. Maybe on how to live by them, or what they do for you, but that feels like a stretch.</li>
