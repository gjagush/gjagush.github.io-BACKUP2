			<li>It is a with a heavy heart that we have to announce the passing of Brother Paul Solomon. Brother Paul passed away on the morning of this past Monday, May 29th. Services will be held tomorrow on Friday, June 2nd, at the Moore Funeral Home on North Davis Drive in Arlington. It was an honor to call him a friend, Companion, and Brother. Paul was very passionate about Masonry. He was a Past Master of Julian Field Lodge, and was a member of multiple organizations, including Texas Chapter and Council, Moslah Shrine, and the Fort Worth Scottish Rite Valley. He played in the Moslah Shrine Band and was a 32nd Degree Knight Commander of the Court of Honor in the Scottish Rite. When I was just starting out in the Craft, I constantly asked him a lot of stupid questions, and he gave me a lot of thoughtful (patient) answers. He was always down to sit down and chat, whether for educational purposes, or just for fun. Practicing degree work and profeciences with him was always fun because he would give you this very wise-looking nod when you got something right. It was impossible to walk away from a conversation with Brother Paul and not feel like you'd learned something, or improved yourself in some way. He was a good man, and the mortal world is left a little less rich for his passing, but Heaven has gained a great man. Please pray for Paul's family, and rejoice that he is with his Loving Creator.</li>
            <li>I'd like to move on to regular news now, if that's okay.</li>
            <li>May 25th - Scottish Rite Festive Board</li>

                    <li>Tom Spencer - great job as Table Master and generally quite funny.</li>
                    <li>Eddie Robinson - talked about baseball, was hilarious. A pleasure to listen to.</li>
                    <li>If you've never been to a festive board, table lodge, or Saint John's Feast, whatever your lodge calls it, go! Super fun.</li>

	<li>Closing Thoughts on Episode Content (max 2 min per person)</li>
	<li>Quote</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This week's Quote is from one of my favorite books, <em>Old Tiler Talks</em>, by Brother Carl H Claudy. In the chapter "On the Painful Process of Becoming a Past Master," the New Brother and the Old Tiler have a chat about the newly-installed Worshipful Master, Brother Jamison. Brother Jamison makes a very ambitious speech, towards which the Old Tiler is a little skeptical, which surprises the New Brother. The Old Tiler explains that no Worshipful Master ever truly succeeds at the goals he sets at the beginning of the year, and the New Brother asks, "do you think he shouldn't try, then?" The Old Tiler responds:
				<blockquote>
				<p>"Heaven forbid! Of course he should try. We should all try. The officers should try, and do try. But if we all succeeded in our straining after perfection, there wouldn't be any fun left in the world at all, or any glory in Masonry. In a perfect world, Masonry would have no place. Since Masonry is in existence to make men better, if all men were best, it wouldn't be needed.</p>
				<p>"No, Brother, it's a good thing for the lodge that Jamison can't make this a perfect lodge of perfect Masons. If he could, we wouldn't have any excuse for being. But if  he didn't try, he wouldn't be the good man that he is."</p>
