			<li>It is a with a heavy heart that we have to announce the passing of Brother Paul Arnold Solomon.
                <ul>
                    <li>Brother Paul passed away on the morning of Memorial Day, Monday, the 29th of May, at the age of 72.</li>
                    <li>He was born on April 18th, 1945 in Conway, South Carolina to Al Solomon and Elise Satisky.</li>
                    <li>Brother Paul was preceded in death by his parents, his wife Carolyn, his son Stephen, and his brother Steve.</li>
                    <li>He is survived by his sons, Andrew and Josh; his grand children, Brandon, Tiffany, Zach, Alex, Meagan, Briana, Jacob, and Kaleigh; and his great-grandchildren, Serina, Alaina, Reagan, and Jasmine.</li>
                    <li>It was an honor to call him a friend, Companion, and Brother.</li>
                    <li>Brother Paul was very passionate about Masonry.</li>
                    <li>He was a Past Master and the sitting secretary of Julian Feild Lodge #908, and a member of multiple organizations, including Texas Chapter & Council, Moslah Shrine, the Moslah Shrine Band, and the Fort Worth Scottish Rite Valley.</li>
                    <li>He was a Scottish Rite 32nd Degree Knight Commander of the Court of Honor.</li>
                    <li>We will miss hearing him play his trumpet before Scottish Rite stated meeting dinners.</li>
                    <li>Brother Paul was thoughtful, kind, and always eager to help.</li>
                    <li>When I first started out in Masonry, I constantly badgered him with questions, to which he always had wonderful, educational replies.</li>
                    <li>He was always willing to sit down and chat, for both education and fun.</li>
                    <li>Practicing degree work and proficiencies was immensely fun. Whenever you got something right after struggling with it for a while, he'd give you this wise-looking nod.</li>
                    <li>It was impossible to walk away from a conversation with Brother Paul and not feel like you'd learned something, bettered yourself, or brightened your day in some way.</li>
                    <li>Brother Paul was a good man, and the mortal world is left a little less rich for his passing, but Heaven has gained a great man.</li>
                    <li>Graveside services for Brother Paul will be held at 11 AM tomorrow on Friday, June 2nd, in the Moore Memorial Gardens in Arlington. Please bring your aprong and come wearing a dark coat and tie.</li>
                    <li>Please pray for Paul's family. Celebrate his life, and rejoice now that he is in the arms of his Loving Creator.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>I'd like to move on to regular news now, if that's okay.</li>
            <li>May 25th - Scottish Rite Festive Board</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Great time</li>
                    <li>Really complicated at first, but then easy</li>
                    <li>Fines for ettiquete mistakes</li>
                    <li>Tom Spencer - great job as Table Master and generally quite funny.</li>
                    <li>Eddie Robinson - talked about baseball, was hilarious. A pleasure to listen to.</li>
                    <li>If you've never been to a festive board, table lodge, or Saint John's Feast, whatever your lodge calls it, go! Super fun.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>May 27th - Temple Open House</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pretty quiet</li>
                    <li>Good time hanging out with other Brothers, even if there weren't many visitors</li>
                    <li>apparently other temples has hit or miss with either no or only a few, or a lot of visitors.</li>
                    <li>Memorial Day Weekends was kind of rough, I think.</li>

	<li>Closing Thoughts on Episode Content (max 2 min per person)</li>
	<li>Quote</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This week's Quote is from one of my favorite books, <em>Old Tiler Talks</em>, by Brother Carl H Claudy. In the chapter "On the Painful Process of Becoming a Past Master," the New Brother and the Old Tiler have a chat about the newly-installed Worshipful Master, Brother Jamison. Brother Jamison makes a very ambitious speech, towards which the Old Tiler is a little skeptical, which surprises the New Brother. The Old Tiler explains that no Worshipful Master ever truly succeeds at the goals he sets at the beginning of the year, and the New Brother asks, "do you think he shouldn't try, then?" The Old Tiler responds:
				<blockquote>
				<p>"Heaven forbid! Of course he should try. We should all try. The officers should try, and do try. But if we all succeeded in our straining after perfection, there wouldn't be any fun left in the world at all, or any glory in Masonry. In a perfect world, Masonry would have no place. Since Masonry is in existence to make men better, if all men were best, it wouldn't be needed.</p>
				<p>"No, Brother, it's a good thing for the lodge that Jamison can't make this a perfect lodge of perfect Masons. If he could, we wouldn't have any excuse for being. But if  he didn't try, he wouldn't be the good man that he is."</p>
