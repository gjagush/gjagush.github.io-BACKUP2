			<li>It is a with a heavy heart that we have to announce the passing of Brother Paul Solomon. Brother Paul passed away on the morning of this past Monday, May 29th. Services will be held tomorrow on Friday, June 2nd, at the Moore Funeral Home on North Davis Drive in Arlington. It was an honor to call him a friend, Companion, and Brother. Paul was very passionate about Masonry. He was a Past Master of Julian Field Lodge, and was a member of multiple organizations, including Texas Chapter and Council, Moslah Shrine, and the Fort Worth Scottish Rite Valley. He played in the Moslah Shrine Band and was a 32nd Degree Knight Commander of the Court of Honor in the Scottish Rite. When I was just starting out in the Craft, I constantly asked him a lot of stupid questions, and he gave me a lot of thoughtful (patient) answers. He was always down to sit down and chat, whether for educational purposes, or just for fun. Practicing degree work and profeciences with him was always fun because he would give you this very wise-looking nod when you got something right. It was impossible to walk away from a conversation with Brother Paul and not feel like you'd learned something, or improved yourself in some way. He was a good man, and the mortal world is left a little less rich for his passing, but Heaven has gained a great man. Please pray for Paul's family, and rejoice that he is with his Loving Creator. </li>
            <li>I'd like to move on to regular news now, if that's okay.</li>
