  <p>Please join us this week in our fireside chat as we talk about what it means to walk and act as a Mason. What's the deal with charity? How to you make sure that you're still in touch with your morals? How do we apply the idea of the cornerstone of a building to ourselves? Brothers Rhit Moore, Grant Gates, and Gabriel Jagush get wonderfully sidetracked for a bit on news and then get to work (we get started on the main subject at around the 24 minute mark). Afterwards, tune in (1 hr 18 min mark) for listing of local events.</p>
